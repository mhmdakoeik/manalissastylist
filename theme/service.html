    <h2>Childhood and early life</h2>
    <p>
      Andrei Tarkovsky was born in the village of Zavrazhye in the Yuryevetsky
      District of the Ivanovo Industrial Oblast (modern-day Kadyysky District of
      the Kostroma Oblast, Russia) to the poet and translator
      <span class="link">Arseny Aleksandrovich Tarkovsky</span>, a native of
      Yelysavethrad (now Kropyvnytskyi, Ukraine), and Maria Ivanova Vishnyakova,
      a graduate of the <em>Maxim Gorky Literature Institute</em> who later
      worked as a corrector; she was born in Moscow in the Dubasov family
      estate.

    <p>
      According to the family legend, Tarkovsky's ancestors on his father's side
      were princes from the <span class="link">Shamkhalate of Tarki</span>,
      Dagestan, although his sister Marina Tarkovskaya who did a detailed
      research on their genealogy called it "a myth, even a prank of sorts,"
      stressing that none of the documents confirms this version.

    <h2>Film school student</h2>
    <p>
      Upon returning from the research expedition in 1954, Tarkovsky applied at
      the <em>State Institute of Cinematography ðŸŽ¥</em> and was admitted to the
      film-directing program. He was in the same class as
      <em>Irma Raush</em> whom he married in April 1957.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early Khrushchev era offered good opportunities for young film
      directors. Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were
      directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many
      of them by young directors. The Khrushchev Thaw relaxed Soviet social
      restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North
      American literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films
      of the <span class="link">Italian neorealists</span>,
      <span class="link">French New Wave</span>, and of directors such as
      <em>Kurosawa</em>, <em>BuÃ±uel</em>, <em>Bergman</em>, <em>Bresson</em>,
      <em>Wajda</em> (whose film Ashes and Diamonds influenced Tarkovsky) and
      <em>Mizoguchi</em>.

      <h3>ðŸ’¡ Inspiration</h3>
      <p>
        Tarkovsky was, according to fellow student Shavkat Abdusalmov,
        fascinated by <em>Japanese films</em>. He was amazed by how every
        character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a
        Samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special
        and put into the limelight. Tarkovsky has also expressed interest in
        <em>art of Haiku</em> and its ability to create "images in such a way
        that they mean nothing beyond themselves"

      He also wrote several screenplays. Furthermore, he directed the play
      Hamlet for the stage in Moscow, directed the opera Boris Godunov in
      London, and he directed a radio production of the short story Turnabout by
      William Faulkner. He also wrote Sculpting in Time, a book on film theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tarkovsky's <em>first feature film</em> was Ivan's Childhood in 1962. He
      then directed Andrei Rublev in 1966, Solaris in 1972, Mirror in 1975 and
      Stalker in 1979. The documentary <em>Voyage in Time</em> was produced in
      Italy in 1982, as was Nostalghia in 1983. His last film The Sacrifice was
      produced in Sweden in 1986. Tarkovsky was personally involved in writing
      the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a cowriter. Tarkovsky
      once said:
      <cite>"A director who realizes somebody else's screenplay without being
        involved in it becomes a mere illustrator, resulting in dead and
        monotonous films.""</cite>
